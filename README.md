This is the course project of ENV 872 Environmental Data Exploration, in collaboration of Mickey Zhang and Shuer Li.
This project explores how social vulnerability relates to forest cover (tree canopy) across North Carolina counties. Using county-level data from the CDC Social Vulnerability Index (SVI, 2018) and tree canopy data from the NLCD 2019 Tree Canopy Cover dataset, we investigate whether areas with higher vulnerability have lower access to forest and green space.

Here's the project rubric:
1. Git & GitHub Usage
• Repository shows consistent commits across the project timeline.
• Commit messages are descriptive and meaningful.
• Repository includes organized folders for code, data, and outputs.
• Collaborators’ contributions are visible through commit history.	/3

2. Project Context & Hypothesis
• Provides clear context and motivation for the research question.
• States a testable hypothesis or set of hypotheses.
• Hypothesis is logically connected to the data and analytical approach.	/3

3. Data Sources & Description
• Lists all datasets used and explains how they were obtained.
• Includes relevant metadata (variables, units, structure, etc.).
• Discusses data reliability, limitations, or collection methods if applicable.	/4

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
• Describes dataset characteristics (e.g., distributions, variable types).
• Identifies missing data and outliers, if any, and how dealt with.
• Uses clear and relevant visualizations or tables.
• Narrative connects EDA results to hypothesis and analysis plan.	/4

5. Data Wrangling & Preparation
• Clearly shows the steps and R code used for cleaning, transforming, and merging data.
• Explains rationale for wrangling choices (e.g., handling of missing values, variable creation).
• Workflow is reproducible and logically ordered.	/4

6. Analysis & Interpretation
• Analytical methods are appropriate for the research question.
• Assumptions are stated and justified.
• Results are presented clearly with code, output, and visualizations.
• Findings are interpreted correctly in context of the hypothesis.	/4

7. Discussion & Reflection
• Summarizes key findings in relation to the hypothesis.
• Discusses issues or limitations encountered during analysis.
• Suggests potential improvements or next steps for future work.
• Demonstrates critical thinking about the research process.
